# Flutter and SwiftUI animation comparisons

Flutter and SwiftUI sample code for various animation scenarios.

## Samples
Each sample has a Flutter and SwiftUI equivlent, see the `flutter/` and `swiftui/` subdirectories.

'* **Implicit Animations (scale_effect.dart)** - Compare's SwiftUI's .animation view modifier with Flutter's implicitly animated widgets'
* **withAnimation (color_change.dart)** - Compares SwiftUI's withAnimation compares with Flutter's implicit animations
* **Transitions (fade_in.dart)** - Compares SwiftUI's .transition view modifier with Flutter's TweenAnimationBuilder (Flutter does not currently support transition effects)
* **Matched Geometry / Hero (swap.dart)** - Compares SwiftUI's matchedGeometryEffect with a best-effort Flutter sample (Flutter does not support general-purpose hero / matched geometry animations)
